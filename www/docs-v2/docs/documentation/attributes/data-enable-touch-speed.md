# data-enable-touch-speed

We disable the parallax effect when a touch event is detected by default. However, if you want to enable the parallax effect on touch devices, you can use the `data-enable-touch-speed` attribute.

By adding this attribute to the element, you can override the default behavior and allow the parallax effect to be active even on touch devices. This allows for a consistent parallax experience across different types of devices.

Please note that enabling the parallax effect on touch devices may have implications for the user experience, as touch interactions and scrolling may behave differently compared to traditional mouse-based interactions. Use this attribute with caution and ensure that the parallax effect enhances the overall user experience on touch devices.
