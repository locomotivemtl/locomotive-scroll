# data-scroll-css-progress

If you declare this attribute, it will add a CSS variable `--progress` to the element. This variable represents the current progress of the element and ranges between `0` and `1`.

By adding `--progress` as a CSS variable, you can utilize it in your CSS styles to create dynamic effects or animations based on the scrolling progress of the element.
