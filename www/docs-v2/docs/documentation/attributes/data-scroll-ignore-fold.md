# data-scroll-ignore-fold

If an element is within the fold (visible portion of the viewport), its offset is automatically adjusted to start its progress from its starting position. However, if you want to ignore this default behavior and prevent the offset adjustment, you can use the `data-scroll-ignore-fold` attribute.

Please note that by using the `data-scroll-ignore-fold` attribute, the element's progress will not be influenced by its position within the fold, and its offset will remain unchanged throughout the scrolling process.
