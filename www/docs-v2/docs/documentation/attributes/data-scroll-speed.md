# data-scroll-speed

-   **Type:** `number`

Specifies the parallax speed for the element. A negative value will reverse the direction of the parallax effect.

Note: The value represents the translation of the element relative to the scrolling. For example, if the value is `1`, it means that for every 1px scrolled, the element translates by 1px. If the value is `.5`, it means that for every 1px scrolled, the element translates by 0.5px.
