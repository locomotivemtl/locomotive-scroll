#### Horizontal styles

If you are utilizing the horizontal feature, we recommend applying the following CSS rules:

```css
/* Only necessary with horizontal scrolling */
html[data-scroll-orientation="horizontal"] {
    body {
        width: fit-content;
    }
    [data-scroll-container] {
        display: flex;
    }
}
```

### Let's try

```html
<main style="height: 150vh;">
    <div>
        <h1>Hello ðŸ‘‹</h1>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2 data-scroll data-scroll-speed="0.5">What's up?</h2>
        <p data-scroll data-scroll-speed="0.8">ðŸ˜¬</p>
    </div>
</main>
```

```js
